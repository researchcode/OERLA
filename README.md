Learning Analytics in Open Educational Resources

This repository contains the software developed to support teachers and experts in the educational field to create and evaluate the web accessibility and quality of Open Educational Resources (OERs).

Instructions are given so that the software can be installed in the ATutor Learning Management System (LMS) and in some cases in other LMSs.

This work is part of the research conducted during the development of my MSc and the PhD at the University of Girona.
